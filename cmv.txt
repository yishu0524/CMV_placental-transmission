DESCRIPTION: Grace M Kepler, Harvey Thomas Banks, Marie Davidian,and  Eric  S  Rosenberg.  ¡°A  model  for  HCMV  infectionin  immunosuppressed  patients¡±.  In:Mathematical andcomputer modelling49.7-8 (2009), pp. 1653¨C1663.

- V is the viral load
- E virus-specific immune effector cells
- RI actively-infected cells
- RS susceptible cells
- RL latently-infected cells
;- TC is the number of target cells, 
;- IC is the number of productively infected cells, 
;- VL is the viral load

;The possible effects of IFN in this model are to reduce 
;- either the production of virions from infected cells by a fraction (1 - epsilon) 
;- or the de novo rate of infection by a fraction (1 - eta).

Parameters:
;- Target cells are produced at rate s and die with death rate constant d.
;- Cells become infected with de novo infection rate constant beta, once infected, die with rate constant delta
;- Hepatitis C virions are produced by infected cells at an average rate of p virions per cell per day and are cleared with clearance rate constant c

- lambda=1e-3; %Cell replenishment rate
- effector=9; %HCMV-specific effector cell term
- epsilonS=0; %Level of immune suppression
- f=1; %Number of infecting virions per cell
- rS=4e2; %Equilibrium level of susceptible cells

- tH=2; %Half-life of virions during antiviral treatment
- tD=1.5; %Doubling time of the virions
- Ee=10; %Equilibrium level of HCMV-specific effector cells
- Ve=1e-2; %Equilibrium level of virions
